clipgrab
========

Slightly customized version of ClipGrab (http://clipgrab.org/)

See [README](https://github.com/FreedomBen/clipgrab/blob/master/README) for build instructions if you are building yourself.

Unless you want to hack on the code, I would recommend [downloading the pre-built AppImage file](https://clipgrab.org/).

You'll need to make the AppImage executable, then you can run it:

```sh
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x ClipGrab-3.9.6-x86_64.AppImage
./ClipGrab-3.9.6-x86_64.AppImage
```
