Compiling ClipGrab is really easy.

You will only need the Qt4 developer libraries in order to compile the program.
In addition, ffmpeg (no developer libs necessary) needs to be installed.


To compile ClipGrab, simply execute
qmake clipgrab.pro && make

This will create an executable "clipgrab" that you can start via ./clipgrab.
